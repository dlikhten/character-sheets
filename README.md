= Ideas

- Allow for character base stats, skills, attacks (hand-to-hand, etc, whatever they are called is irrelevant)
- Allow for indication of: + stats per level, + skills per level, skill max numbers, skill bonuses
- Allow for indications of: one-time base stat changes at certain levels. This will be either "set to" or "add to" or "remove from" changes. Any stat can be modified.
- Allow for indications of: skill gains at certain level. EX: 5 new psionics at level 3.
- Each change is stored in history, so we can go back and forth.


= With Accounts

- Dungeon master invites emails
- Emails see all invited games
- Emails can see only their own character sheet
- Emails can make modifications, but DM can see what they did via history.
- DMs can indicate that game is  "locked" so only the DM can make modifications until game is unlocked.

= Devices

Ensure this works on:

- Chrome
- iPad
- Android Tablet
- phones is a maybe, not that comfortable.
